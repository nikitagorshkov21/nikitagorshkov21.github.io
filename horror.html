								<p> A film by legendary director Stanley Kubrick
								<p> I first saw this movie when I was 16 </p>
								<p> With practically no screamers, the film manages to scare the insistent </p>
								<p> One of the first Kubrick films I saw </p>
								<p> The film is also attractive from an aesthetic point of view </p>
								<p> I advise you to watch this film for those who want to feel the feeling of anxiety and fear </p>

								<p> Director John Carpenter was able to create a cult film with minimal budget </p>
								<p> The plot in this film is quite simple and linear </p>
								<p> But the main thing in it is suspense </p>
								<p> I was on pins and needles for the whole film, as the atmosphere of horror was conveyed perfectly </p>
								<p> The main plus of the film is Michael Myers, as he is considered one of the most memorable villains in cinema </p>
								<p> I advise you to watch this film alone, as the feeling of horror will be fully conveyed </p>
