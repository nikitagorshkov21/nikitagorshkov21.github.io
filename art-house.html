							<p> Filmed by young director Robert Eggers </p>
							<p> This is his second full-length film in his career </p>
							<p> The first time I watched this movie with friends and was completely delighted with watching it</p>
							<p> The hallmark of this film is definitely the acting performance of Robert Pattinson and William Defoe </p>
							<p> The plot in this film is rather unusual and incomprehensible, so you need to watch the film several times </p>
							<p> The film is also filled with references to Greek mythology </p>
							<p> I advise everyone to watch the movie; however, not everyone will like it </p>

							<p> I watched this film on the advice of my best friend and did not regret it </p>
							<p> Unusual cinema that captivates literally from the first minutes </p>
							<p> The film tries to explore the essence of man through surrealism </p>
							<p> The plot is exciting, funny and carefree, but at the same time very sad </p>
							<p> Awesome cast duo lets you enjoy your movie to the fullest </p>
							<p> I strongly advise everyone to watch this movie </p>
